# Rick and Morty


Rick and Morty is a popular adult animated science fiction sitcom and very popular among programmers. That's why I also made an application. 
The application consists of cards of all characters where you can read more about it by clicking on each. Characters  by their status - alive, dead or unknown and move from one character page to the next.  There is also a separate page with episodes of the show. They can also be filtered by title.



> “To live is to risk it all; otherwise you’re just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you.” — Rick
